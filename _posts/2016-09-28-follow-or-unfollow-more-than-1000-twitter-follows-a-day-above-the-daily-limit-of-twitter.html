<h3>follow or unfollow more than 1000 twitter follows in a day more than the daily limit of twitter</h3>
<p>Hi there, Previously my twitter id was hacked and some body followed so many people. And I still have no idea who did this. But I found a way to unfollow them all at one. First I loaded full list of people my twitter used to follow.</p>
<p>Then on right click and selecting console in my browser I typed this command in console.</p>
<pre class="lang-bsh prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="pln">$(".user-actions-follow-button").click();
</span></code></pre>
<p>This way you can follow/unfollow more than 1400. And You can read about the twitter limitationsÂ <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/66885" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>But to start following people again you will have wait for another day, with the same command you can friend them again :) enjoy!</p>
