<p>Most common 4 types of personalities stated by Carlo M. Cipolla are as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Helpless</li>
<li>Bandit</li>
<li>Intelligent</li>
<li>Stupid</li>
</ol>
<p>How would you categorize them if get the chance to describe someone’s personality on first encounter. You should read this interesting article if u want to learn this magic. And I will try to describe this in short.</p>
<p>Lets Take an example, If a person is selling second person a goat, he may act as follows</p>
<ol>
<li>Helpless – suffer loss</li>
<li>Bandit – trying to sell overpriced</li>
<li>Intelligent – looks where both can get a happy deal</li>
<li>Stupid – cause lose to both parties.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you know what these 4 types of personalities are, hurry and take notes when u negotiate with someone. Thanks for reading here is the link.</p>
