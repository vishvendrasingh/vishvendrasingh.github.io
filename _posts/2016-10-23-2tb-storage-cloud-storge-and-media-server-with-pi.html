=14920 Rs</p>
<p>and I can say I saved a lot of money not buying a costly media server for home and made it myself. Just happy its ready to dance. So many ideas I have thought to work on. Will be posting about them soon. And I tried this server with HD movie it just showed a little flicker in one of the 4 little cores. I couldn't believe it could handle that much load. So I hope for personal use I wont have to face crashing. It is having a nice fan attached for air suction. Guy u can comment if u got any questions.</p>
