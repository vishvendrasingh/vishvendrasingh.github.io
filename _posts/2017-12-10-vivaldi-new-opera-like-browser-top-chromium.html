<p>Hi,</p>
<p>People talking on many forums that chrome or firefox like browsers are sending data to their server, and making the service very insecure. In many forums people are talking about building their own browser and services but its very tedious task.<!--more--><span id="more-558"></span></p>
<p>So this guy made vivaldi for us that is secure enough for now.</p>
<p>I personally use firefox mostly but this post below made me rethink of what I am using. But its really worth to try.</p>
<p>It is of about 40.6MB in size for windows I am testing. Installation steps are quite easy.</p>

<li>It has task manager</li>
</ol>

<p>2. I use system proxy settings like chrome, and no separate network settings like firefox. Also It does not have VPN option like opera provides in Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; security &gt; VPN</p>

<p>3. Other option are very similar to other browser and have all the functionalities that chromium browser have.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_616" align="alignnone" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-616" src="https://vishvendra.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-09-15-02_10_58-DuckDuckGo-300x141.png" alt="DuckDuckGo" width="300" height="141" /> DuckDuckGo[/caption]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For now it is making very good progress on being a trustworthy internet browser but still it lacks many good functionalities those other browsers have. Also they are seen thrice in new.ycombinator.com for their appreciated  work &amp; progress – <a href="https://shivalink.com/news.php?from=0&amp;news_c=&amp;size=20&amp;q=vivaldi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://shivalink.com/news.php?from=0&amp;news_c=&amp;size=20&amp;q=vivaldi</a> .Please visit the following url for more information.</p>
