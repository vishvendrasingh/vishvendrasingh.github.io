<p><b>E</b>arly this year, the <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/03/28/521813464/as-congress-repeals-internet-privacy-rules-putting-your-options-in-perspective">U.S. Congress rolled back Internet privacy rules</a>, giving service providers free reign to track, store and sell browsing data. In July, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/15/543782396/doj-demands-files-on-anti-trump-activists-and-a-web-hosting-company-resists">issued a warrant to DreamHost</a>, asking for a list of everyone <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/14/donald-trump-inauguration-protest-website-search-warrant-dreamhost">who visited DisruptJ20.org</a> — a site used to plan protests at President Trump’s inauguration. Both events raise important questions about online privacy, and many consumers are turning to Virtual Private Networks (VPN).</p>
<h2>More private than private browsing</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/features/private-browsing/?utm_source=blog.mozilla.org&amp;utm_campaign=internet_citizen&amp;utm_medium=referral">Firefox private browsing with tracking protection</a> is great at protecting you from invasive trackers and keeping your browser history secret, but when you surf the web, you leave footprints that Firefox can’t erase — your IP address is logged at the sites you visit and your ISP may keep records. That usually isn’t an issue, but the sites you visit could expose you to <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/15/543782396/doj-demands-files-on-anti-trump-activists-and-a-web-hosting-company-resists">unwanted attention from government agencies</a> or even hackers. A VPN can hide those footprints from prying eyes and add an extra layer of security against hackers.</p>
