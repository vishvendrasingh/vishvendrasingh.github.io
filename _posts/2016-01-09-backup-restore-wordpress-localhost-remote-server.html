<p>Recently I stuck in the middle. I had completed the wordpress theme in wamp(Windows), and now I wanted to move it to cPanel (linux). And the had full path like C:\wamp\www. Now when I uploaded this theme to server, the uploaded version of it was totally distorted.<br />
I tried different approaches to solve this problem like find &amp; replace &amp; many other efforts.<br />
But after all they did not worked for all the problem of path in option table for wordpress database.<br />
Then I found this plugin https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-clone-by-wp-academy/ that makes copy of your database now you need to install this plugin.<br />
Secondly you have to create a backup of your wordpress. Then It will give you a link of zip archive. Now upload that link to your server.<br />
To restore this backup into the Remote Server just give the link like this http://your-domain.com/path-to-link.zip.<br />
And just click the upload you will see the same wordpress will is restored in remote server also.</p>
