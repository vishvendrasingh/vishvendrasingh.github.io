<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Its something not very new, but quite young for me. I tried to make search Engin like google and yahoo. Its really not very easy to make one. It is also not very useful for you people until it is mature enough to answer your queries. It may take some weeks and lot of processing power to do that. It's continuously increasing its database. You can see more better results every minute. And its fast enough to give it a try. You can ask any thing you want. Here is the link <a href="https://bringmefast.com" target="_blank">https://bringmefast.com</a></p>
<p>This is like copy of source-code of crawler that is used for collecting data form web.</p>
